<h3> ★ Description </h3>

<ul>
  <li> Audio Barrier works in both 2D and 3D, it make a boudary to prevent Audio Sources to follow player. </li>
  <li><i> Audio Sources Interaction: </i></li>
  <ul>
    <li> Imagine you have an Audio Source, such as the sound of rain. </li>
    <li> When the player is outside the defined boundary, the rain sound follows them seamlessly. </li>
    <li> However, as soon as the player steps inside a house or any other enclosed space, the audio begins to change dynamically. </li>
  </ul>
  <li><i> Dynamic Audio Effects: </i></li>
  <ul>
    <li> Attenuation: As the player moves deeper into the enclosed space, the rain sound gradually becomes quieter. </li>
    <li> Wall Interaction: When the player approaches a wall that connects to the outside (where the rain is falling), the sound becomes louder. </li>
  </ul>
  <li> Whether it’s rain, footsteps, or other environmental sounds, the tool ensures that audio behaves authentically based on the player’s position relative to the defined boundaries. </li>
</ul>
